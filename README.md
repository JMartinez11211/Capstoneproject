# Capstoneproject
Watchmen-log is a full stack CRUD app. 
Application was made to keep  daily log reports written by Security officers in one database. Removes the need for paper and pen reports with easy access and storage.
the backend is written in Java 17 on Springboot, while the database is MySQL.
the front end is written in React js.
the application still needs more user friendly features that can be added later on, for example searching reports by Security officer name or by dates written.
Application should make data manegment easier and help take up less space in total.(for example in one of my previous jobs security had over 20 notebooks full of reports for just 1 year.)
